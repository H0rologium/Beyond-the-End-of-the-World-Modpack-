A fun, semi- expert modpack for minecraft 1.12.2 FORGE

<h3>Please feel free to report issues and/or suggestions! Feedback helps!</h3>

Primary focus is on letting the player choose what they want to do with a huge array of big mods.


The main focus is tech-related (AE2, Buildcraft, IC2, Industrial Foregoing, Thermal Dynamics, Railcraft, Future Pack)

The mod does include mods related to fantasy (Doomlike Dungeons, Roguelike Dungeons, Astral Sorcery, Apotheosis)

There are two gates to progression, Scaling Health and Gamestages (Includes quests).

Includes more things to fight as well (DivineRPG, Scape and Run Parasites, Mutant Beasts, Infernal Mobs, Bloodmoon)

And lots of exploration (Future Pack, Aether, The Beneath)

In order to get the pack to work, you WILL need a recommended minimum of 10GB ram allocated.
