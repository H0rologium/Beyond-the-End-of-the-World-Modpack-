# Beyond-the-End-of-the-World-Modpack-
A fun modpack for minecraft 1.12.2 FORGE

<h3>Please feel free to report issues and/or suggestions! Feedback helps!</h3>

Primary focus is on letting the player choose what they want to do with a huge array of big mods. Minecraft has always been a fun sandbox game, so why not expand it by a vast amount with a large arrangement of new options!


The main focus is tech-related (AE2, Buildcraft, IC2, Industrial Foregoing, Thermal Dynamics, Railcraft, Future Pack)

The mod does include mods related to fantasy (Doomlike Dungeons, Roguelike Dungeons, Astral Sorcery, Apotheosis)

The pack has shifted to be more of a kitchen sink, so there is no longer a lot of gated progression aside from some altered crafting recipes.

Includes more things to fight as well (DivineRPG, Scape and Run Parasites, Mutant Beasts, Infernal Mobs, Bloodmoon)

And lots of exploration (Future Pack, Aether, The Beneath, BoP, NetherEx)

Not to mention a lot of performance mods (Entity Culling, Particle Culling, FastWorkbench, Foamfix, Performant, Surge)

In order to get the pack to work, you WILL need a recommended minimum of 10GB ram allocated.

Includes optional configs for extra mods if you feel like adding them: Lycanites Mobs, Optifine.

MODLIST.txt contains all mods necessary as well as their versions.
